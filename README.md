# BMI Calculator 🧑‍⚕️

## About Project

Angela Yu( @angelabauer - instructor) developed this app in a tutorial she gave on udemy. After watching her development, I tried to make a clone of this application on my own. 


## Images of Project

We’re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
